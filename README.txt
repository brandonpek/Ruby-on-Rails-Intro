Hello and welcome to my coding prototype on Ruby on Rails.

The following code following MVC conventions and the CRUD (Create Read Update Destroy) methodology for two related databases - journal entry titles and the entries themselves.

To intialize the code, run "bin/rails server" from the ~/blog directory, and type in localhost:3000 on your internet browser. To edit or destroy an entry, the username authentication is "admin" with password "intern".

Regrettably I was unable to merge my Devise and CanCanCan authentication syntax with this framework in the time constraints of finals and moving out week.

Thanks for your time!
